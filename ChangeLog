	* R/Predicates.R ("!setKeyValue"): Mongo rejects blank keys, so
	check for them here.

2019-06-26  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/RuleTables.R (findRules): Fixed priority issue.

2019-06-24  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/RuleTables.R (findRules): Changed so that the phase argument
	is now optional.

	* R/EIEngine.R (processEvent, handleEvent, runTriggerRules)
	(runContextRules, runResetRules, runObservableRules)
	(runStatusRules): The rule search is now done in processEvent
	instead of being repeated five times in the individual functions.
	Also, processEvent returns NULL if the status has not changed, so
	that it does not need to be resaved if there were no applicable
	rules. 

2019-05-12  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Status.R (Timer): NA in duration bug.

2019-05-07  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/EIEngine.R: Added activate() method, to either insert up
	update as appropriate.

2019-03-18  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/EIEngine.R (runRule, runTRule): No longer a method of
	EIEngine, pulled out to RuleTable.R
	(processEvent, handleEvent): Pulled these out as functions rather
	than methods.
	(runTriggerRules, runStatusRules, runObservableRules)
	(runResetRules, runContextRules): Pulled these out as functions
	rather than methods.

2019-03-06  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Predicates.R (asif.difftime): Rolled back change in
	asif.difftime.  Not sure what this is going to break, but
	currently forcing things to difftimes that should stay as ints or
	reals. 

2019-03-01  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/Predicates.R (asif.difftime): Fixed so that defaults to
	seconds if integer.

	* R/Status.R (parseTimer): Debugged timer parsing.

2019-02-28  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/Status.R (all.equal.Status): Bug where not checking value of
	attributes. 

	* R/Condition.R ("?in"): Check for NULL target value.

	* R/testRules.R (testRule,testQuery,testPredicate): Added check
	for missing fields in test object.

2019-02-02  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/AAGenerics.R (MongoDB):  Putting the calls to the mongo()
	constructor in the reference class objects (EIEngine, &c) was
	causing problems because R would try to build prototype instances
	of the class at package load, and would fail if the mongo string
	was not correct.  Now, uri is set when class is initialized, but
	call to mongo does not occur until database is first accessed.
	Note that this means databases should be accessed by the method
	and not the raw field.

2019-01-21  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/testRules.R (queryTest, predicateTest, ruleTest)
	(ruleTestScript, predicateTestScript, predicateTest): Refactoring
	to (a) use new RuleTest class and (b) use futile.logger.
	(RuleTest): Added this class as a formal class.  

2019-01-19  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/ErrorHandling.R (withJavaLogging): This probably needs to get
	replaced with an appropriate function from futile.logger. (ftry).
	

2019-01-06  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Status.R (all.equal.Status): Status equality checks were
	failing because of name issues.  Fixed by creating an equality
	test method for Statuses which is a little bit more lax.  Not
	thoroughly tested.

2018-12-31  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/testRules.R (queryTest, queryTestScript):  Added.

	* R/Status.R (parseStatus): Added default values for missing fields.
	* R/Events.R (parseEvent): Same thing.
	* R/RuleTable.R (parseRule): Same thing.


2018-12-27  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/Status.R (as.jlist): R/RuleTables.R (as.jlist): changed to
	unparseData prototocol.

2018-09-27  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/RuleTables.R (Rule): Added app to Rule.

	* R/Status.R (Status): Added app and timestamp to Status.

2018-08-14  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* DESCRIPTION (Package): Renamed from EIEngine

2018-07-28  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* DESCRIPTION (Package): Created the package.
