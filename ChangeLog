	* R/AAGenerics.R (MongoDB):  Putting the calls to the mongo()
	constructor in the reference class objects (EIEngine, &c) was
	causing problems because R would try to build prototype instances
	of the class at package load, and would fail if the mongo string
	was not correct.  Now, uri is set when class is initialized, but
	call to mongo does not occur until database is first accessed.
	Note that this means databases should be accessed by the method
	and not the raw field.

	* R/testRules.R (queryTest, predicateTest, ruleTest)
	(ruleTestScript, predicateTestScript, predicateTest): Refactoring
	to (a) use new RuleTest class and (b) use futile.logger.
	(RuleTest): Added this class as a formal class.

	* R/ErrorHandling.R (withJavaLogging): This probably needs to get
	replaced with an appropriate function from futile.logger. (ftry).

	* R/Status.R (all.equal.Status): Status equality checks were
	failing because of name issues.  Fixed by creating an equality
	test method for Statuses which is a little bit more lax.  Not
	thoroughly tested.

	* R/RuleTable.R (parseRule): Same thing.
