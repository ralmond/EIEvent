EIEngine Methods that need tests
o [doc] handleEvent
   
Classes to write methods for:
*  EIEngine
   - Start/Stop
   - testRules
   
o [write] TestSet
o [test] runTest   
   
* Database Setup -- check schemas in setupMongo.js

o [test] Durations must show in seconds [Bug 86]

o [test] parseXXX methods should be robust to [Bug 69]
   - issues with training spaces on context or other fields
   - robust to errors saves as list instead of simple string

o [test] Reset rules need to be based on old rather than new context.  [Bug 82]

* Difftime parsing issues [Proc4 issue?] [Bug 80]
   - {time:"40", units:"secs"} needs to be parsed as a difftime.
   - make sure that
      all.equal(as.difftime(60,units="secs"),as.difftime(1,units="mins"))
      is true.
* Listener that unbundles keylists. [Bug 78]

* Listener that converts lists to strings.

* Need duplicate key association lists. [Bug 77]

o [test] Make ANY and ALL synnonymous [Bug 83]

* Update parser so that the "final" field can be either a message or a
   state. [Bug 81]

* Integerated game tester [Bug 72]
   

* Shiny interface for Loader [Bug 70]

* Shiny interface for EIEvent script [Bug 70]

* Bug in all.equal.Status, need to match
   - character() and integer()
   - NA_character_ and NA_logical_
